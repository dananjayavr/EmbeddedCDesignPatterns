In Harmony method proposed by the author, design only gets done on working software. Design is done as a means to optimize working software

The methodology itself is divided in to three "cycles" : 

- macro-cycle : overall project time line and major milestones. Scale=months
- micro-cycle : production of a single validated increment (aka. build or a prototype). Scale=weeks
- nano-cycle : range of minutes to hours and concentrates on continual execution, debug and unit test. Scale=hours



Microcycle breakdown : 

- prototype definition: collect stakeholder requirements and transform into system requirements for the current micro-cycle.
- object analysis/software analysis: develops software that realizes functional requirements including coding, debugging, and unit testing
- architectural design: optimize the code using design patterns, including coding, debugging and unit testing 
- some intermediate steps that improves upon the architectural design stage
- review: reviewing analysis, design and code for consistency, completeness and correctness
- validation: testing the systems against requirements and add regression testing
- review schedule, risk management plan etc.
- continuous integration: done daily, runs integration tests and updates the always evolving software baseline
- validation: develop test plans, test cases and test environments
